## machine learning practice notebooks 

### Contents :
 1. implementing batch gradient descent with early stopping for SoftMax Regression without using scikit-learn

 2. trained decision tree classifier on iris dataset, decision tree regressor on a noisy quadratic dataset

 3. trained decision tree on moons dataset

 4. trained ensemble model using hard voting with 3 diverse classifiers.

 5. built classifiers for MNIST using multiple models(RF,Extra trees, SVM), improved performance using stacking and voting ensemble

 6. implement PCA on MNIST to check changes in speed and accuracy of RF classifier, visualize high deminsional data using non linear dim red (t-SNE,LLE)
